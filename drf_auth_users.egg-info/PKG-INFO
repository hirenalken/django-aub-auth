Description: =====
        Django social auth
        =====
        
        This app is wrapper around 'social_django' app to create reusable user module with some common APIs required in any
        typical django rest framework project. To use this app, you also need to install `social_django` app.
        
        This app comes with this feature:
        
        1.  API endpoints to register / login user via email and password
        
        2.  API endpoint to take access_token and oauth_user_id as input from frontend and validate that access token to register
            that user in your system.
        
        3.  API endpoint to request password reset link. (you need to configure required settings in your project settings file
            in order to send email with your designed template)
        
        4.  API endpoint to update password.
        
        5.  Email verification link is sent on each new registration.
